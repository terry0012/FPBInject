Fixing firmware the old way is like pulling over and swapping the engine just to change a spark plug. FPBInject lets you work on the engine while the car is still running — replace any function on a live MCU through a serial cable, no reflashing, no debugger, no downtime.

Under the hood, it uses the ARM [Flash Patch and Breakpoint (FPB)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0337/h/debug/about-the-flash-patch-and-breakpoint-unit--fpb-) hardware unit to intercept function calls and redirect them to your custom code in RAM. The original Flash stays untouched — think of it as a detour sign the CPU follows at wire speed.

## Traditional vs FPBInject

```mermaid

    title Iteration cycle comparison (typical STM32 project)
    dateFormat  s
    axisFormat  %Ss

    section Traditional
    Edit code          : a1, 0, 5s
    Compile & link     : a2, after a1, 15s
    Erase flash        : a3, after a2, 3s
    Flash write        : a4, after a3, 5s
    MCU reboot         : a5, after a4, 2s
    Reproduce issue    : a6, after a5, 5s

    section FPBInject
    Edit code          : b1, 0, 5s
    Compile & inject   : b2, after b1, 1s
    Reproduce issue    : b3, after b2, 5s
```

The traditional cycle touches flash on every iteration — compile, erase, write, reboot, then finally reproduce the issue. With FPBInject, the MCU never stops: save your patch, it's live in under a second. No pit stop required.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["caller()<br/>calls foo()"] -->|"FPB intercepts<br/>foo's address"| B["Trampoline<br/>in Flash"]
    B -->|"Jump to RAM"| C["Your Code<br/>in RAM"]
```

The FPB unit matches the target function's address, redirects execution through a trampoline in Flash, which jumps to your replacement function in RAM. All handled by hardware — zero software overhead on the call path.

## Workbench

FPBInject ships with a browser-based workbench for the full workflow: browse symbols, read disassembly, write patches, and inject — all from one interface.

### Symbol Search & Disassembly

Search the firmware's symbol table, click a function to view its disassembly or decompiled source.

![Disassembly View](Docs/images/webserver-disasm.png)

### Manual Inject

Write your replacement function in C, then hit inject. The workbench compiles, uploads, and patches — typically under a second.

![Inject View](Docs/images/webserver-inject.png)

### Auto Inject

Point the workbench at your source directory and enable file watching. Add `/* FPB_INJECT */` before any function you want to patch, then just save the file — the workbench detects the change, recompiles, and re-injects automatically.

## File Transfer (Optional)

FPBInject also supports file transfer over serial — browse, upload, and download files on the device's filesystem. Supports drag-and-drop (files and folders), CRC verification, and progress tracking.

Filesystem backends: POSIX (NuttX VFS, Linux), FatFS, standard C library (stdio), or custom implementations via the `fl_fs_ops_t` interface.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build & Flash Firmware

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FASTSHIFT/FPBInject.git
cd FPBInject

cmake -B build -DAPP_SELECT=3 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/arm-none-eabi-gcc.cmake
cmake --build build

st-flash write build/FPBInject.bin 0x08000000
```

### 2. Start the Workbench

```bash
cd Tools/WebServer
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5500` in your browser, connect to the serial port, load your ELF file, and start patching.

### 3. Or Use the CLI

All commands output JSON, designed for scripting and AI agent integration.

```bash
# Search for functions
python fpb_cli.py search firmware.elf "gpio"

# View disassembly
python fpb_cli.py disasm firmware.elf digitalWrite

# Inject a patch
python fpb_cli.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 --elf firmware.elf \
    --compile-commands build/compile_commands.json \
    inject digitalWrite patch.c
```

See the [CLI Guide](Docs/CLI.md) for the full command reference.

## Writing Patches

Create a C file with the `/* FPB_INJECT */` marker. The function signature must match the original.

```c
#include <Arduino.h>

/* FPB_INJECT */
__attribute__((section(".fpb.text"), used))
void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value) {
    printf("Patched: pin=%d val=%d\n", pin, value);
    value ? digitalWrite_HIGH(pin)
          : digitalWrite_LOW(pin);
}
```

> Calling the original function from injected code is not supported — the FPB redirect applies to all callers, so it would cause infinite recursion.
